Must have:

√ 0. A canvas that compiles
√ 1. Add a paddle that responds to key inputs
√ 2. Add a ball that bounces off the walls and paddles
3. Add bricks that the ball bounces off of.
4. Remove bricks when the ball hits the Bricks

Should have:

1. Every time a row of bricks goes away, the ball goes faster
2. Every time a row of bricks goes away, the paddle gets smaller
3. When a row of bricks disappears, a new one appears behind it.
4. A method for scoring and displaying the score

Nice to have:

1. Each row of bricks is a different Color
2. Animation when the brick is hit
3. the paddle bounces slightly off each wall
4. Sounds play when the ball hits the paddle and the bricks
